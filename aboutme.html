        <h2>The love for travel, and adventure!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the beggining of my journey to become a full stack web developer, my name is Joseph Guajardo!
          Before I get into why I've decided to take a leap into coding, let me tell you a little bit about myself.
          Growing up, I lived in a nice and quit neighborhood in Citrus Heights, CA and went to good schools with good
          academic programs.My family did what they could to put food on the table and keep the lights running,
          but vacation wasn't part of the budget. I decided at a young age that I would make it a priority to see the
          world! So far life has taken me to London, Paris, Amsterdam, Hawaii,
          Texas, and Oregon. Although I haven't made it to all the places that I've wanted to see, I plan to see them in
          the future.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>The past 10 years I have spent my time trying to find my place in life. I've worked in customer service for
          most of my career in places such as Game Stop, Macy's, and at U.S bank as a personal banker. In my time I
          learned the many personalities of the people in the world and what people are capable of accomplishing. I
          learned about peoples history and how to be compassionate to the many cultures that reside in the United
          States. 2020 was a tough year for the world. This is the year that I decided I need to make a change. It was
          the year that I decided that I was capable of accomplishing great things. I see that future full of
          technology,and I want to be part of the growth. This why I decided I would like to learn to code, to see what
          makes the websites I visit on a day to day basis work.

        <h2>What does the future hold?</h2>
        <p>What does the future hold for me? Only time will tell, but I would like to take the first big step into the
          new world. I have made great strides in the first 3 months of learning to code, and this is just the
          beggining. I think that I have so many great ideas, and I hope the Coding Boot Camp
          at UC Davis is going to help me bring them to life! As a great man once said,
          <cite>"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in
            your favor" - Elon Musk</cite>
          This resonates with me because I've always felt that I wasn't smart enough to do anything in life, so the odds
          are of my own doing. I hope to do some good in the world, and I believe it starts here!
