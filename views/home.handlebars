            <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Joseph Guajardo, and welcome to the begining of my journey to become
                a full stack
                web
                developer.
                Before I get into why I've decided to take a leap into coding, let me tell you a little bit about
                myself.
                Growing up, I lived in a nice and quit neighborhood in Citrus Heights, CA. I went to good schools
                with
                good
                academic programs included my high school, Bella Vista. My family did a great job putting food on
                the
                table
                and keep the lights running,
                but vacation wasn't part of the budget. I decided at a young age that I would make it a priority to
                see
                the
                world! So far life has taken me to London, Paris, Amsterdam, Hawaii,
                Texas, and Oregon. Although I haven't made it to all the places that I've wanted to see, I plan to
                see
                them in
                the near future.

        <div class="card-body">

            <p class="card-text">The past 10 years I have spent my time trying to find my place in life. I've worked in
                customer service
                for
                most of my career in places such as Game Stop, Macy's, and at U.S bank as a personal banker. In my time
                I
                learned the many personalities of the people in the world and what they are capable of accomplishing. I
                learned about peoples history and how to be compassionate to the many cultures that reside in the United
                States. 2020 was a tough year for the world. This is the year that I decided I need to make a change. It
                was
                the year that I decided that I was capable of accomplishing great things, and wanted to put that mindset
                to
                the test. I see that the future is full of
                technology,and I want to be part of the growth. This why I decided I would like to learn to code, to see
                what
                makes the websites I visit on a day to day basis function.

            <p class="card-text">What does the future hold for me? Only time will tell, but I would like to take the
                first big step into
                the
                new world. I have made great strides in the first 3 months of learning to code, and this is just the
                begining. I think that I have so many great ideas, and I hope the Coding Boot Camp
                at UC Davis is going to help me bring them to life! As a great man once said,
                <cite>"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in
                    your favor" - Elon Musk</cite>
                This resonates with me because I've always felt that I wasn't smart enough to do anything in life, so
                the odds
                are of my own doing. I hope to do some good in the world, and I believe it starts here!
